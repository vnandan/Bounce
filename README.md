A small javascript browser based game of "running from the thorns". Uses a game JS library "Gamelib"by Brent Silby.
The project uses only three of the files in the library:
1. core.js
2. keyboard.js
3. sprites.js

I have uploaded the entire libarary files anyway.

More details on the library + docs. Visit
